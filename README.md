## Overview
This simple regression project comprises an Artificial Neural Network to predict the estimate of the amount that the customer is willing to spend on a car. Here, we have made use of (Gender, Age, Annual Salary, Credit Card Debt & Net-Worth) to gauge the amount. 
## Motivation
What is the best way to acquire proficiency in a library? To practically implement a simple project utilizing that library, to learn its dependencies & respective functions for the further implementation of complex applications. My basic idea was to explore Tensorflow & Keras library which lead me to find the following Dataset for practical execution.
